        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Greetings, everyone! If you are from Tamil Nadu, you have likely heard of Velliangiri Hills. Known as the Kailash of the South, this sacred place is dedicated to Lord Shiva. At the summit stands a Swayambu Lingam, a naturally formed Shiva Lingam. Located in Coimbatore district, Velliangiri is part of the majestic Western Ghats and is considered the second hardest trek in Tamil Nadu, following the Pothigai Malai (Agathiyar Hills) trek. Covering seven hills, this trek spans approximately 15-16 km and reaches a height of 6,127 ft (around 1,800 meters).</p>
        <!-- <img src="images/velliangiri_intro.jpg" alt="intro Velliangiri Hills"> -->

        <h2>The Toughest Trek</h2>
        <p>I have been trekking since childhood, but this was the most challenging trek I have ever done. There are treks which are harder than this, but that are located in the north as far as I heard. This one truly tested my endurance.</p>

        <h2>Journey to the Base</h2>
        <p>My journey began in Bangalore, where my colleague and I boarded a bus to Coimbatore at 12 PM. We had a light breakfast before the long ride. Around 9 PM, we reached Coimbatore, on the way another friend joined us near Salem. From Gandhipuram Bus Stand, we had dinner and purchased some essential snacks. We then took a bus to Poondi Village, the starting point of the trek, which took about an hour and cost ₹60. The famous Isha Yoga Center is located just 5 km before Velliangiri Stop.</p>
        <p>After reaching the base, we bought bamboo sticks for ₹30 each. These sticks are especially useful for first-time trekkers and help maintain balance while descending. I’m not a beginner to trekking, but the stick has made my way a little easier, especially while getting down. I chose a slightly conical stick, which was comfortable to hold and provided a good grip on rocky surfaces. I recommend avoiding narrow sticks, as they can be uncomfortable to hold for long hours.</p>

            <figcaption>Ready to go.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>The Trek Begins</h2>
        <p>We began our journey by offering prayers. The initial plan was to start at 12:15 AM (March 9, 2025), but due to heavy crowds, we had to wait in a queue for an hour. The actual trek commenced at 1:15 AM. Just a few steps in, we can see thousands of used bamboo sticks left behind by previous trekkers. Yes, we can use them as well, but select carefully as some might be broken. The crowd was dense, and people were moving both up and down, making the path congested. From our research, the first and seventh hills were considered the toughest. However, I personally found the first hill the most challenging. As Director Pradeep Ranganathan once said, “Thambi, first step mattum than kastam.” If you can conquer the first hill, you can complete the entire journey. The first hill consists entirely of steps, which put immense strain on our leg muscles. Till fourth hill steps will be there. At the end of the first hill, we reached the Vellai Vinayakar Temple. Several small shops here sold items like cucumber, glucose, and snacks, , we had lime soda to recharge ourselves. We resumed the journey by worshiping and thanking Lord Vinayaka for taking us this far, and prayed to make us complete the journey.</p>
        
        <p>Second Hill: This hill was comparatively easier, as we had recharged ourselves with lime soda. Most of the crowd had dispersed, making the climb less strenuous. Since we were trekking at night, we didn't feel the difficulty as much. There were stairs throughout. At the end of the second hill, we saw a smooth, slippery rock, which signified that we had completed 2 out of the 7 hills.</p>
        
        <p>Third Hill: The third hill is similar to the second, but with a mix of steps, rocks, and sand. Numerous shops line the path, though prices increase exponentially as you ascend. A funny incident happened here—after watching multiple vlogs, we were confident that once we could no longer see steps, we had completed the fourth hill. Thinking we had come a long way, we started celebrating, sharing excited conversations among ourselves. A few meters ahead, we spotted a shop and decided to reward ourselves with some snacks. Casually, we asked the shopkeeper which hill we were on, expecting to hear “fifth.” To our shock, he replied, “You are just starting the third hill.” We were stunned, exchanging looks before bursting into laughter at our own miscalculation. Somewhere along the third hill, we also came across the Pambati Siddhar Cave.</p>
        
        <p>Fourth Hill: is a mix of mid-length grasses, rocky trails, and smooth powdery soil. Watch every step carefully, as the entire trek must be done with caution—we never know when we might lose balance.The view from the fourth hill is breathtaking. You can see Isha Yoga Center, and the twinkling lights from nearby villages make it a beautiful sightseeing spot at night. However, one must be extremely cautious. We once sat on a remote rock to enjoy the scenery, only to realize after a few minutes that it had a steep surface—a single misstep could have been disastrous. Despite the risks, I loved this spot for its serene beauty and peacefulness especially for stargazing. Also you feel the chillness even if you are travelling during the day-time.</p>
        
        <p>It's advisable to carry citrus fruits or berries, as the crowded path and changing altitude caused ear blockages, dizziness, and nausea, making the trek feel suffocating at times—thankfully, my gooseberries helped ease the discomfort. At the end of this challenging stretch, we reached Ottan Siddhar Samadhi, a significant landmark believed to mark the last of the structured stone steps, a tribute to the one who built them.</p>

        </figure>

        <p>Fifth Hill: This hill is relatively plain and the easier stretches to cross. It is also known as Thiruneer Malai (Holy Ash Hill) due to its white sedimentary rocks. Though the path is less strenuous, it runs dangerously close to steep drops, so again be cautious. As we transition from the fifth to the sixth hill, we come across the Bheeman Kali Urundai, a massive rock that is widely mentioned by trekkers. Despite its popularity, the story behind it remains unknown—if anyone knows the story behind, do share.</p>

            <figcaption>Bheeman Kali Urundai</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Sixth Hill: This hill is the only one where you climb up and descend, making it a unique part of the trek. Unlike the flat fifth hill, this one is rocky and uneven, but by this point, you’ve already come a long way my friend! Huge boulders (giant rocks) line the path, many with scribbled graffiti like "#boy_name loves #girl_name", and even an arrow in between😂. Nope, I didn’t do these cringes! Heehe. This hill is a popular resting spot for night trekkers, with a camping area, but since we were short on time, we pushed forward. For the first time in the trek, we had to descend a steep, sandy path, which was crowded and tricky. Our legs, conditioned for climbing, struggled with the new motion. Unmayave kastam da, Samy!
        </p>
        <p>At the end of the sixth hill, there is a water body called Aanthi sunai. We reached Aanthi sunai at morning 5am. The water was freezing cold. Anyways, me and my mate were so determined, so took a freezing bath. But it wasn’t so hard, coz ever since I moved to bangalore I was practicing cold showers, so I think I was used to it. There will be a Lingam in mid of the water body, as it was too crowded inside and we don’t have enough time so we didn't get a chance to touch it. Instead, we worshipped at another Lingam on the other side, marked our foreheads with sacred ash, and resumed our journey. In the transition of sixth to seventh hill there we can notice two giant rocks.</p>

        <h2>The Final Climb: Seventh Hill</h2>
        <p>This hill is as challenging as the first, but the key difference is that there are no stairs or proper footholds. Surprisingly, this made the climb a bit easier for me compared to the first hill, as continuous steps tend to lock the leg muscles in the first hill. Here, our bamboo sticks became our best companions, helping us maintain balance on the steep ascent.</p>
        <p>The excitement of reaching the summit and seeing Lord Shiva pushed us forward. Finally, at 6:30 AM, we made it to the top! We joined the queue for the morning darshan, and with each step closer, I felt my heart freeze with devotion. A powerful spiritual force surrounded me. Near the summit, we first came across a Vinayakar statue, and just a few meters ahead stood the Swayambu Lingam—the sacred, self-manifested Shiva Lingam. I felt incredibly blessed to be there.</p>

            <figcaption>Swayambu Lingam</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p> I worshipped the Lord Shiva and prayed to fulfill the wishes of my family and close ones. Before starting the journey I have noted down the wishes of my family members and my close ones on a paper. Before the trek, I had written down the wishes of my family and close ones on a piece of paper, promising myself that I will submit it at the summit. And yes, I fulfilled my promise! I tied the wish list to a trident at the peak. Just then, I realized—I was above the clouds. I could feel the mist brushing against my face, making my hair damp. At 6,000 feet, there was no sight of the ground—only an endless bed of clouds beneath me. At that moment, I felt closer to God than to the earth. ✨

        </figure>

        <h2>The Descent: </h2>
        <p>After spending some time at the summit, we began our descent around 8 AM. Unlike the climb, the way down was sandy and slippery, making it tricky to maintain balance. At one point, I even slipped and fell—So getting down safe is more important. At the spot with the two giant rocks, I noticed people selling rare medicinal herbs. At Aanthi Sunai, I took a moment to wash my legs, as the seventh hill had completely coated them in soil. I also collected some sacred ash. In less than an hour, I reached midway through the sixth hill. From here, the view of the summit was simply awesome.
        </p>
        <figure class="image-container">

            <figcaption>Majestic View of seventh hill from top of sixth hill.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>As we continued our descent, the clouds were still moving at our level, wrapping us in their mist. Along the way, I met many fellow trekkers, including a few courageous women who had completed the entire trek and were on their way back. In good time, I reached Ottan Siddhar Samadhi, but after that, the next three hills truly tested my patience. The paths we had crossed at night now seemed incredibly dangerous in daylight. What we didn't notice in the dark was now alarmingly clear—one wrong step could have erased our lifeline from our palms.</p>
        <figure class="image-container">
            <img src="images/six_path.jpg" alt="Path of sixth hill" id="imgtype3">
            <figcaption>Path of sixth hill.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>On the way up, I had barely drunk a liter of water and never felt thirsty. But on the way down, under the harsh sun, thirst hit me hard. Once again, gooseberries came to my rescue. It reminded me of a bedtime story my mom once told me—about a soldier who offered a gooseberry to a thirsty king, an act of kindness that forged a friendship and earned him a kingdom in return. I truly realized the power of gooseberries, and wherever I go, I always carry one in my bag.</p>
        <p>Motivating myself, I descended past the third hill, step by step. At a small Sunai (water stream) in the third hill, we refilled our bottles. Recharged, we resumed our journey. But as the heat intensified, our pace slowed down, draining the last ounces of our energy.</p>
        <p>Finally, we reached the Vellai Vinayakar Temple. Just one more hill to descend! A huge thanks to my bamboo stick—without it descending would have been even harder in the first hill. My thigh muscles were locked from the constant motion on the stairs, but I was determined—my resting spot was only at the base.</p>
        <p>I pushed through the pain, and at exactly 12 PM, I reached the base. The moment my feet touched level ground, they were burning with exhaustion. I splashed water on them and freshened up. At the base, food was being offered, and I gratefully took a plate of prasadam, refueling my body as I waited for my friends to arrive. </p>
        <p>After some time, we all reunited and offered our prayers at the temple, feeling immense gratitude for completing this incredible journey. With one final glance at the towering stairs that tested our strength and spirit, we carried the memories of this trek in our hearts and moved on, knowing that Velliangiri had left an everlasting mark on our souls.</p>

        <h2>Post-Trekking Experience:</h2>
        <p>After completing our trek, we headed to Isha Yoga Center to freshen up and take some rest. With a few hours to spare before our 8:30 PM bus to Bangalore, we spent time exploring and soaking in the peaceful ambiance of the ashram. As night fell, we boarded our bus from Gandhipuram Bus Stand and reached Bangalore early Monday morning at 4 AM. And Yes, it’s monday, time to switch gears and dive back into the weekday routine—yes, have to go for work.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>Trekking Velliangiri Hills is not just a physical journey; it is an experience that transforms you. It challenges your body and mind, but in the end, it rewards you spiritually. Whether you are a seasoned trekker or a beginner, this trek will leave a lasting impact on you. If you ever get the chance, embrace the journey—you won't regret it!</p>
        <p>This trek remains in my heart. Every trek should have a pure motive. In all my previous treks, sunrise or the view was my goal, but this time, my promise for a better life for my close ones meant more than anything else. I wish to dedicate this trek to my family and the beautiful star ✨.</p>
