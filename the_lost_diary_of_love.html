            <p>A continuation..</p>

        <!-- <p style="text-align: center;"><i> "The seven hills will test you physically and mentally, but rewards you spiritually in the end. This trek remains in my heart. I wish to dedicate this journey to my parents and the beautiful star ✨." </i></p>
               -->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Exactly <b>a couple of years ago</b>, I was overwhelmed by the chaos around me. I felt deeply depressed, like something decaying my heart from inside. Even now, it's hard for me to describe the emotional state I was in at that time. It was then, my senior forwarded me a blog titled <i>“The Lost Diary of Love”</i>, an beautiful piece of work by Sarukrishna. The story didn’t necessarily give me hope, but helped to figure me out the way to ease my grief. It gave me a <b>spark to write.</b></p>
        <p><b>“The Lost Diary of Love”</b>(<a href="https://voiceofsk.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-lost-diary-of-love.html?m=1">link</a>), an amazing writing by <b>Sarukrishna.</b>
             Do read that blog before heading to the next session. At the last, he have mentioned <i>“Some love stories have missing endings just like this one!”.</i> But I was unsatisfied with the end at that time, so I decided to complete the story. Either the ending be positive or negative, atleast it should end.</p>    
        
        <h3>So, I wrote a continuation, as follows…</h3>
        <p>The next day, i <b>got up</b> after the sun directly hit my eye. It was <b>almost noon</b>> already.
        It took me a bit of time to realize where I am. Then i asked my fellow mates about the previous day incident. 
        He smiled and said, that isn’t the previous day, literally that is today early morning, we found you in old creepy hidden cave 
        looked unconscious and found you have been <b>bitten by a poisonous spider.</b> 'A spider!' i wondered, i felt no pain though!  
        <br>    
        <i>(the hardness after reading the diary made me unaware of the spider bitten)</i>
        </p>

        <p>After having my medicinal meal I tried to recall everything, and those made me <b>curious to know the owner</b> of the diary.
         So, i went to the local people. <b>After a few inquiries</b> i came to know that, one year before a person seems bone and skinny
          found inside the cave. They <b>admitted him in the hospital.</b> After hearing he was taken to hospital, i got some hope.</p>

        <p>I rushed to the hospital, inquired about him. There I came to know nothing, but I <b>got his address and contact number.</b> 
        I tried to reach him, but he changed his number. i Finally <b>decided to reach him in direct</b> as his address is reachable 
        distance from my home in Chennai.</p>
        
        <p>There are still two more days to complete my camp, but i <b>didnt have enough patience</b> to wait. I started dreaming every possibilities 
            of his life. <b>Questions circled through my mind,</b> 'what happened to him?', 'Did he alive now?', 'Did he meet her again', 'or 
            how he survived the situation' and so. These two days went like two months. I got the same feeling of sitting in a math class 
            before PET period. Also im afraid, whatif he changed his place too?  </p>

        <p>After i returned to chennai, i travelling to his place where <b>my fear came true.</b> But i somehow got his new address 
            with help of his ex-house owner. To be a surprise he is resideing a floor above my apartment. Also came to know that 
            <b>he got married recently.</b> These things made me even too curious to know what happened. Did he meet her again? 
            Did he married the same girl or not? Did he found someone to share his love? How did he overcomed the suffering? 
            Did he happy in this relationship? Did his parent forced him to get married? these questions circled through my mind, 
            even <b>i cant focus on the road</b> im driving now. I feel my eyes are filled with <b>tear</b> i dont know why it came out.</p>

        <p>The time is around 6pm now, the <b>sun is ready to set.</b> And i finally reached the bike parking, i dont even have enough 
            patience to park my bike. i rushed to his door and rang the bell. Now i can clearly hear my <b>heartbeats over the bell.</b> 
            A woman came out to open the door. I asked about him, and she invited and asked me to sit in the hall. I have been glancing 
            the environment. After a few minutes, a 5'8'' gentleman with looking physic and a warm smile in his face greeted me nicely 
            like a true gentleman. I'm wondered to see such a bright man who once planned to destroy his own life. I explained him, how i knew him.</p>

        <p>He replied with a calm smile and started his words. I finally <b>decided to end my life</b> in that cave with my last few words 
            written. I was there for few days without food or water. The only thing i remember was, i heard a voices of a group of people 
            carrying me. I laughed inside as <b>it wasn't an angel,</b> it was a group of men came to take me to heaven. Then, when i woke up 
            i was unable to open my eye against the forced beam of sunrays from the window. That's when i saw a girl sitting near to me, 
            holding my hands and looked tired of sobbed. I could remember the same face sitting in a moving train where i was staring 
            from platform. Yeah, thats her (a deep breathe). Meanwhile, his wife served me a cup of coffee. Then he continued, 
            <b>'Yeah, that was her',</b> the one who i loved, the one who i wish to be with me, the one who left me, is now with me.
             'Bro, thats life' <b>we dont know what comes next.</b> It may be good or bad. He continued, I tried hard to make my body to sit on the 
             bed.She got up from my hand and stared at me with her surprised fluid filled beautiful eyes. 'Ram!' thats what i barely heard from
              her mouth. Then i got black out. But i could feel how she cared me those time. After some medication, I again came to conscious.
            Still she was there for me. At that critical do or die situation i expressed 
              my love as <b>'I wish you to hold my hands till my last breathe, will you?'.</b> Her eyes were filled with tears, i can feel a drop fell 
            on my hand. Yes, im feared of her answer, but this time <b>i am brave enough to face it.</b> Already setthu polachu vanthute, marupadiyum saava ethirkolla enaku bayam ila.
               I have already faced a death once, so it wouldn't be too hard for me. I looked into her eyes. She stared at me. 
               Gradually her eyes turned into evil, she created a evil smile on her face and said 'Yes, i would. But this would be your last breathe" 
               (and started to laugh in a evil way as in old Hollywood movies). Then slowly brought her hands near to my neck and hold it a little tightly.
                I got really shocked. She came near to my ear, said 'Bhoom..' and kissed me with all her emotions. On that spot i was ready to die,
                 I felt my 25 years of life got a satisfaction.<i>(this time its an angel)</i> She hold her kiss for few more seconds.
                  I went to heaven with a free painless ticket😂. 2 pair of eyes were filled with fluids. She then softly beat me and
                   asked 'it took these many years to convey what i wish to hear?'. I smiled at her. Then she started to laugh with 
            the tears and said with fun 'now literally your last breathe is overed and i gave you the new breathe, can i take my hand!'.
            I begged her "NO!". The thing i like in her is her craziness, even at my worst bedrest she made me laugh. 
            Thats how i got a new life with my favourite person. </p>
        
        <p>After hearing his story my eyes too filled with tears. She then came and sit with him and asked 'ivan ungalaiyum azha vachutana,
         ivanuku ithan velaiya pochu' and gentle beat him in his head. They are a good couple. If things going hard, stay calm, 
         there might be a happy ending tho. Noone knows what comes next. So live the moment with joy.
          I went to my room, a floor below, simply laid on the bed and <b>close my eyes hoping a new tomorrow with a smile in my face.</b>
        </p>
        
        <h3>A note to readers,</h3>
        <p>This was written a couple of years ago. There might be some grammatical mistakes,
             also my way of looking into things might be dramatic.
             If you find anything contrary, kindly forgive me and feel free to share your feedback.</p>
        

        <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
        <p>We never know what might happen next. With confidence, put a step ahead, be brave to face what comes next.</p>
        <p>On apr 22, 2023, I realised <b>I had fallen for her.</b> At that time, 
        it was too much for me to handle and also her past is so much messed up,
        I don’t want to make her life more complicated.
        But, when I was ready to confess, <b>life had already moved too far.</b> 
        Still, no one came to replace her. When Sarukrishna mentioned, <i>“Some love stories have missing endings”,</i> 
        I was not ready to accept that. But for my better future, 
        I decided not to wait for her any longer. My words on 22nd apr, 2023 – 
        <i>“I decided to let go”</i>-- are repeating here with more conviction. Thanks for being a part of my life, <i style="color: white;">Vishnu (a) Vishnu Priya.</i></p>
        
        <p>On a fine day, on this same month last year she </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"> "An Art doesn't have to be perfect; and neither does she" </p>
    

        <p style="text-align: center;"> "Time and Tide wait for none !" </p>
